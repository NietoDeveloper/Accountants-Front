    ```

2.  **Frontend Installation:**
    Navigate to the `frontend` directory (or `client`, `web`, etc.).
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend/ # Go back to root and then into frontend
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in both the `backend` and `frontend` directories based on the `.[env_example]` files provided. See the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section for details.

    * `backend/.env`
